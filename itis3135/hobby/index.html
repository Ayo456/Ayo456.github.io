        <h2>What is Narrative Analysis to Me?</h2>
        <p>
          To me I think that Books, Shows, Movies, and Video Games all have a
          way of portraying a Narrative that is meant to resonate with its
          auidence. Books empower its narrative with the use of the reader's
          imagination to empower the effect of the narrative. Shows and Movies
          use actors, sets, and CGI to accurate display their own stories to the
          world. Video Games use the talent of voice actors, motion capture,
          musical scores, and programming to turn stories into interactive and
          immersive expereinces for players.

        <p>
          I think that it's important that we understand all of the work,
          talent, effort, and time that goes into making these creations for
          people. Understanding the narrative analysis behind these creations
          allows us to appreciate them on a deeper level and see the impact they
          have on our lives.

        <h2>Who Brings These Stories to Life?</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that there are many different people and roles that are
          necessary to bring stories to life in various forms of media. I enjoy
          learning about the different aspects hat go into the creation of these
          stories so that I can appreciate them better. Authors are the creative
          minds that take their ideas and are able to turn them into stories
          that captivate readers. Directors are the visionaries who translate
          written narratives into visual spectacles, guiding the overall tone
          and pace of films and shows. On-screen actors embody characters,
          bringing them to life through their performances, while voice actors
          lend their voices to animated characters and video game personas,
          adding depth and emotion without physical presence.

          Stan Lee is very well known for the creative issues of Marvel Comics
          which gained so much popularity that his work was adapted in the form
          of shows, movies, and video games. Andy Samberg is a well-known actor
          whos work in movies and shows (mostly comedies) have brought his
          characters to life in an eccentric way that resonates with the
          audience. Yuri Lowenthal is a well respected professional in the
          voice-acting field. His work in video games and animated shows has
          brought many characters to life through his vocal performances such as
          Sasuke Uchiha in "Naruto" and Spider-Man in various games.

        <h2>When Do Stories Hit the Hardest?</h2>
        <p>
          For me a good time to enjoy stories is when I need to escape from
          reality for a bit. Whether it's after a long day at work or during a
          lazy weekend, immersing myself in a well-crafted narrative helps me
          relax and recharge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other times I like to are at night when I have some quiet time to
          myself. The stillness of the night, and even sometimes the ambience of
          snow or rain allows me to fully focus on the story without
          distractions, making the experience more immersive and impactful.

      <section id="where">
        <h2>Where Can You Enjoy Stories?</h2>
        <p>
          Personally I like to enjoy immersing myself in stories in a place
          where I can comfortably sit for long periods of time. For movies and
          shows I like to sit in a comfy chair or couch with dim lighting to set
          the mood but sometimes my bed is just as good. When I play video games
          I like to be at my desk with my gaming setup so that I can be fully
          focused on the game without distractions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as much as I can enjoy by myself, I also enjoy sharing these
          stories with friends and family. Whether it's watching a movie
          together or playing a co-op game, experiencing stories with others can
          enhance the experience and create lasting memories.
        </p>

      <section id="how">
        <h2>How Do Stories Work Beneath the Surface?</h2>
        <p>
          To me personally, stories hit the hardest in many ways. One of them is
          when you can personally connect with a character to where you can see
          yourself in them. Another way is when a story tackles real-world
          issues that resonate with the audience on a deeper level. Your own
          experiences can also shape how you perceive a story, making certain
          narratives more impactful during specific times in your life.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Beyond the obvious plot, stories work beneath the surface through
          recurring themes, character arcs, and motifs that shape meaning and
          emotional resonance. Subtext and symbolism communicate ideas without
          stating them outright, while point of view and voice control what the
          audience knows and feels. Careful pacing, foreshadowing, and the
          escalation of conflict build tension and investment, so the surface
          events reflect deeper truths and linger with the reader or viewer long
          after the story ends.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why Do These Stories Matter So Much?</h2>
        <p>
          I think that aside from just creating media for entertainment, these
          forms of media also bring people together. Stories have the power to
          unite people from different backgrounds and cultures, and it can
          create a community of people who share similar interests and values.
        </p>

        <p>
          They can also inspire change by shedding light on important social
          issues and encouraging critical thinking. Ultimately, stories matter
          because they reflect our shared humanity and help us make sense of the
          world around us. This is the reason that stories are important to our
          world, and we should openly encourage and embrace the art of
          storytelling.
