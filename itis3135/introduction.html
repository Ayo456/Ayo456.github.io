        <p class="white-text">I’m now a Junior in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science here at UNCC. My hobbies include gaming, physical activities, and binging shows. I usually keep to myself, but I can be very extraverted around the right people and during the right times.

                <p class="center-text white-text">"There's no such thing as a painless lesson. They just don't exist. Sacrifices are necessary. You can't gain anything without losing something first. But if you learn to endure that pain, you'll find you've gained a heart strong enough to endure anything”</p>
